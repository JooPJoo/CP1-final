# CP1-final (Jigglesworth dancing penguin)

## Summary

This project will have a plush doll that will dance and be controlled with a remote control. In order to achieve this, a plush doll will be gutted and then place mechanical and electrical parts that will serve as the bone structure and nervous system like a human. The remote control will command the doll to dance certain moves.

Code will be written within arduino to include movements of the doll and various dance moves with the press of buttons on the remote control.

## Component Parts

Mechanical parts include, the doll itself, parts to make up the arms and head, servo motors, breadboard, jumper wires, arduino UNO, cardboard to house the UNO and bread boards, balsa wood to create bone structure, IR sensor, remote control, and, batteries or USB cable. The IR sensor will allow a remote control to send signals to the board in order to control the servo motors inside the doll.

Code that will be implemented include how the servo motors are controlled and buttons associated with the remote control to make the doll dance certain moves.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write Proposal, determine what supplies I need 
- Week 2: Flush out initial code for your idea, test code on arduino with parts connected.
- Week 3: Continue to write and finalize code, put everything together and verify everything works.
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

Challenges with this project include how to properly place the servos with eachother as they would resemble a human body with joints.  It also took some time to figure out the positions that the servos would activate and move to to resemble the dance moves. Once the code was completed and test runs were done, the final challenge was to put everything together into the doll itself and making sure the servos had enough room to play with.
